**`Developer with Passion üî•`**

I'm a backend developer that tries to improve his code writing ability everyday. Currently most projects in my portfolio are from university, because I spend the most of my time on them, but couple other projects are from my personal collection, because programming is also my hobby, so that is what I do after university work too. I love making small games/applications so I could improve with each and every one of them and I also like learning new technologies in the programming field.

 <summary><h3>üõ£ My Coding Journey</h3></summary>   
   My coding journey started once I stumbled upon files of a website that was made with php. I didn't knew anything about coding then, but because I'm curious, I dug a little bit deeper and opened one php file, then opened a couple more... Then I started making some changes to parts of the code that I understood just from common sense. It was exciting seeing those changes happen in my browser. I felt power. The was website behaving as I wanted. Something sparked inside of me and I started watching YouTube videos about coding. At the time, I wasn't watching a lot of them. But then I started watching more and more. I didn't really knew what to watch exactly, because there are a lot of frameworks, a lot of programming languages, a lot of things you can create with those programming languages and I didn't knew what I want to do with this knowledge. I was just interested in how text can make computer behave as I want to. After some time my school started "Robotics School" activity after lessons in which students learned how to make simple programs for phones with Java and how to make games with Unity. When I started working with Unity, I was really hooked. I started working with Unity in my free time at home after school making small games, but they all got deleted, because once I got to the point where I needed artwork, I just left that project and started another one. I was just interested in coding. And after years of learning Unity and C#, I started making simple WinForms applications, tried new programming languages. I also worked as a freelancer in Fiverr, where I made Unity scripts, and there I completed 62 orders and got straight 5 star ratings. Now I am studying in Kaunas University of Technology and seek to learn more about programming, design patters, architectures, best practises, how should I write more efficient, managable, cleaner and just overall better code.
